        <p> Enebeli Jahswill is a 22 year old Web Design And Development student of the Southern Alberta Institute Of Technology (SAIT).
             His passion for tech started when a family friend who was a developer introduced me to the Python programming language, 
             and since then, I have dabbled in various aspects of the Tech industry. 
             Some of the things I have come to have knowledge about since my interest in Tech started are:
              Backend development using Python programming language (Took a self-paced course on SoloLearn, 
              although I didn't complete it), Data Analytics using Power Bi 
              (Took an online course/internship with <a href="https://lms.terrahq.co/" target="_blank" id="sh">
            sidehustle.ng</a>) and more recently have started gaining knowledge on languages used for web development
             (HTML, CSS and Javascript).
        <hr>
            One other thing I also have an interest in is Photography and Videography, although I am no expert when it comes 
            to taking pictures, I always try to find an opportunity to capture good moments. 
             It is my hope that someday I will master the complexities and intricacies of the 
             programming media world and become one of the leading developer/media mogul around.
        <hr>
            Asides being interested in the Tech industry, there are other things I enjoy doing,
             like playing Table Tennis, watching movies, reading novels, 
                listening to songs and observing nature. 
                I don't do any of these things as much as I used to, but I try to make time for them.</p>
